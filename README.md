You can set-up the wireless lan of your headless Raspberry PI in just three steps.

#### Etch the image

Download the BerryLan flavoured [Raspbian image](https://downloads.nymea.io/images/berrylan/raspbian-stretch-berrylan-lite-latest.zip) and flash the SD Card. We recommend Etcher to do that.

That's it, have fun!
